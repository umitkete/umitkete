- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @umitkete
- I've been teaching mathematics for a long time. I'm interested in mathematics. Now I've started learning Python.
- I write programs that I can use in my own work. I'm also interested in artificial intelligence and I'm working on this subject.
- For now, I only know python language and I'm open to improvement. I'm trying to be better.
